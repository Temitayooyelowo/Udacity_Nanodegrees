The union and intersection are done using sets to avoid duplicates.

Union: adds all the elements in the first list to the set and new list and only adds to the new list elements from the second list that are not already in the set.

Intersection: adds all the elements in the first list to the set and new list and only adds to the new list elements from the second list that are already in the set.
